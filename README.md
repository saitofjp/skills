## Skills in this repo

- **[simulated-persona-creator](skills/simulated-persona-creator/SKILL.md)** — Create a behavior-driven test persona (a portable Persona Contract) that another tester can simulate consistently.
- **[simulated-persona-tester](skills/simulated-persona-tester/SKILL.md)** — Simulate how a supplied persona would naturally encounter and use a product, and report the result as a hypothesis-generating persona test.

Use them together: create a persona with `simulated-persona-creator`, then run it against your product with `simulated-persona-tester`.
